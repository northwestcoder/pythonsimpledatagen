# for this example, you will need to pip install flask
# and/or read the docs on flask: https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/
#
# this example provides a payload URL for fake data
#
# from this directory, you would start flask from the command line like so:
#   $export FLASK_APP=flaskserver.py
#   $flask run
#
# it will then say
# "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/"
# 
# and if you go to 
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/dynamic
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/static
# you should see 1,000 lines of randomly generated data (the random one will change on each refresh)
